What is here:

./setup.csh 	: master csh script which runs everything
./build_dyes.py	: will create initial coordinates by attaching dyes to protein 
			structure in a way which avoids overlaps.

In general, you need to provide a PDB file with cysteines where the dyes are 
supposed to be attached, generated by any means. It probably helps if the 
atom names follow the Amber convention.

The script build_dyes.py will then add a single dye to a specified cysteine. Usage
is:
	./build_dyes.py resnum dye inp.pdb out.pdb

where resnum is the residue number (in inp.pdb) of the cystein to be replaced,
dye is either 488 or 594, inp.pdb is the input pdb (!) and out.pdb will be written to.

For two or more dyes, one simply runs the script repeatedly to add each dye in 
succession.

First test the example in setup.csh which should work; then try to apply it
to your own system.
