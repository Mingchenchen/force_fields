 
This example illustrates a complete setup of Alheimer's beta 40 peptide 
conjugated to two chromophores at the termini.

The python script first adds the dyes to the included PDB file (which 
could be an experimental protein structure or, as in this case, generated 
by an external tool such as amber tools. It does this using the 
"../build_dyes_amberdye.py" script from this distribution together
with the patched pdb files for the dyes.

The script then goes through the various steps of generating the topology,
minimizing, adding solvent etc.
